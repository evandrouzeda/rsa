# RSA Implementation in python
I ran this program in conda enviroment using Python 3.9.9 64-bit, inside of Docker container using continuumio/anaconda image.

To run you will need to install miller-rabin package:
```
pip install miller-rabin
```

Probably you will need to install C/C++ compiler and libs too:

```
apt install gcc
```
```
apt install libgmp3-dev
```
